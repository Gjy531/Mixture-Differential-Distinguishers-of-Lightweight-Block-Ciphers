[SKINNY] folder contains the search codes for generating the mixture differential distinguishers and the verification codes to verify the distinguishers we found. 

To generate the distinguishers , preinstallion is [Gurobi]. This work is done by version 10.0.

To get the results, run

```sh
g++ Skinny.cpp basic.cpp -I/$GUROBI_HOME/include -L/$GUROBI_HOME/lib -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi100 -lm -o Skinny.out

nohup ./Skinny.out
```

To run the verification programm, MPI package need to be installed and change the library path and include path in Makefile according to your installation. Run mingw32-make (in Windows) to compile the C++ codes.

To test 7-round by running on 8 processors, run

```sh
mpiexec -n 8 SKINNY_Quadruple_MPI_RNG 7
```
You get a summary of number of quaries and number of right quadruples on each process, total queries, number of total right quadruples and the probability. We also reserved codes (commented in current version) for comparison with full round SKINNY as random permutation.

[MANTIS] This repository contains two folders: [MILP](https://github.com/shenshensunshine/LightweightMixtureDifferentialCipher-Mantis/tree/main/MILP) and [Verification](https://github.com/shenshensunshine/LightweightMixtureDifferentialCipher-Mantis/tree/main/Verification). [MILP](https://github.com/shenshensunshine/LightweightMixtureDifferentialCipher-Mantis/tree/main/MILP) folder contains source codes to search for the mixture differential distinguishers covering 4-  6- and 8- round of Mantis. The codes are launched on Linux OS. To run our codes preinstallation is [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) for solving constraint programming problems. To get the 15 mixture trails for 5-round Mantis, run

+ `g++ Mantis1.cpp basic.cpp -I/$GUROBI_HOME/include -L/$GUROBI_HOME/lib -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi100 -lm -o Mantis1.out`
+ `nohup ./Mantis1.out`

[Verification](https://github.com/shenshensunshine/LightweightMixtureDifferentialCipher-Mantis/tree/main/Verification) folder contains the verification codes to verify the quadruple distinguishers we found. To run the programm, MPI package need to be installed and change the library path and include path in Makefile according to your installation path.  Run `mingw32-make` (in Windows) to compile the C++ codes. 

To test 6-round in algorithm with 14-round as parameter in random permutaion by running on 8 processors, run

```sh
mpiexec -n 8 MANTIS_Quadruple_MPI_RNG 6 14
```

You get a summary of number of quaries and number of right quadruples on each process, total queries, number of total right quadruples and the probability. We also reserved codes (commented in current version) for comparison with full round MANTIS as random permutation.
